This project is a work in progress and aims to replicate the functionality of Ben Eater's breadboard computer in C#. The goal is to have fun and build a virtual computer that is more easily modified than Ben's breadboard version.

## Why Build a Breadboard Computer?

Building a breadboard computer allows you to:

- **Learn Computer Architecture**: Understand the fundamental principles of how a computer works at the hardware level.
- **Explore Digital Electronics**: Gain hands-on experience with digital components like transistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits.
- **Improve Problem-Solving Skills**: Tackle complex problems and develop a systematic approach to troubleshooting.
- **Appreciate Modern Computers**: Gain a greater appreciation for the complexity and elegance of modern computer systems.
